#storm-docker

## Intro

[Apache Storm](https://storm.apache.org) is a Python programming library for object-relational mapping between one or more SQL databases and Python objects. It allows Python developers to formulate complex queries spanning multiple database tables to support dynamic storage and retrieval of object information.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers, by providing an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating-system-level virtualization on Linux, Mac OS and Windows.
